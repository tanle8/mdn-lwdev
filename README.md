## Roadmap

1. Complete beginner:

    If you are a complete beginner to web development, we'd recommend that you start by working through our [Getting started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) module, which provides a practical introduction to web development.

2. Beyond the basics

    If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn HTML and CSS in detail: start with our [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) module and move on to our [Introduction to CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS) module.

3. Moving onto scripting:

    If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move onto JavaScript or server-side development. Begin with our [JavaScript first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) and [Server-side first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps) modules.

## Topics covered

The following list is contain all the topics that MDN learning area covers.

1. [Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
    Provides a practical introduction to web development for complete beginners.

2. [HTML — Structuring the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
    HTML is the language that we use to structure the different parts of our content and define what their meaning or purpose is. This topic teaches HTML in detail.

3. [CSS — Styling the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
    CSS is the language that we can use to style and lay out our web content, as well as adding behavior like animation. This topic provides comprehensive coverage of CSS.

4. [JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
    JavaScript is the scripting language used to add dynamic functionality to web pages. This topic teaches all the essentials needed to become comfortable with writing and understanding JavaScript.

5. [Accessibility — make the web usable by everyone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility)
    Accessibility is the practice of making web content available to as many people as possible regardless of disability, device, locale, or other differentiating factors. This topic gives you all you need to know.

6. [Tools and testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing)
    This topic is a place to cover tools developers use to facilitate their work, such as cross browser testing tools.

7. [Server-side website programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side)
    Even if you are concentrating on client-side web development, it is still useful to know about how servers and server-side code features work. This topic provides a general introduction to how the server-side works, and detailed tutorials detailing how to build up a server-side app using two popular frameworks — Django (Python) and Express (node.js).

## Getting code examples

The code examples you'll encounter in the Learning Area are all available on GitHub. If you want to copy them all to your computer, the easiest way is to:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mdn/learning-area
```

You can update the learning-area repository with any changes made to the master version on GitHub with the following steps:

    1. In your command prompt/terminal, go inside the learning-area directory using cd. For example, if you were in the parent directory:

    ```shell
        cd learning-area
    ```

    2. Update the repository using the following command:

    ```shell
        git pull
    ```
