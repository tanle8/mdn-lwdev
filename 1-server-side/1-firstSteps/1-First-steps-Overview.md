# Server-side website programming first steps

- [x]

In this, our server-side programming module, we answer a few fundamental questions about server-side programming â€” "what is it?", "how does it differ from client-side programming?", and "why is it so useful?". We then provide an overview of some of the most popular server-side web frameworks, along with guidance on how to select the most suitable framework for creating your first site. Lastly, we provide a high-level introductory article about web server security.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module you don't need to have any knowledge of server-side website programming, or indeed any other type of programming.

You will need to understand "how the web works". We recommend that you first read the following topics:

- [What is a web server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)
- [What software do I need to build a website?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_software_do_I_need)
- [How do you upload files to a web server?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server
)

With that basic understanding, you'll be ready to work your way through the modules in this section.

## Guides

[Introduction to the server side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction)

Welcome to the MDN beginner's server-side programming course! In this first article, we look at Server-side programming  from a high level, answering questions such as "what is it?", "how does it differ from client-side programming?", and "why it is so useful?". After reading this article you'll understand the additional power available to websites through server-side coding.

[Client-Server overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview)

Now that you know the purpose and potential benefits of server-side programming we're going to examine in detail what happens when a server receives a "dynamic request" from a browser. As most website server-side code handles requests and responses in similar ways, this will help you understand what you need to do when writing your own code.

[Server-side web frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Web_frameworks)

The last article showed you what a server-side web application needs to do in order to respond to requests from a web browser. Now we show how web frameworks can simplify these tasks, and help you choose the right framework for your first server-side web application.

[Website security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Website_security)

Website security requires vigilance in all aspects of website design and usage. This introductory article won't make you a website security guru, but it will help you understand the first important steps you can take to harden your web application against the most common threats.

## Assessments

This "overview" module doesn't have any assessment because we haven't yet shown you any code.  We do hope at this point you have a good understanding of what sorts of functionality you can deliver using server-side programming and you have made a decision about what server-side web framework you will use to create your first website.
