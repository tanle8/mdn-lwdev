Getting started with server-side programming is usually easier than with client-side development, because dynamic websites tend to perform a lot of very similar operations:

- retrieving data from a database and displaying it in a page,
- validating user-entered data and saving it in a database,
- checking user permissions and logging users in,
- etc.

and they are constructed using web frameworks that make these and other common web server operations `easy`.

A basic knowledge of programming concepts (or of a particular programming language) is useful, but not essential. Similarly, expertise in client-side coding is not required, but a basic knowledge will help you work better with the developers creating your client-side web front end.

You will need to understand "how the web works". We recommend that you first read the following topics:

1. What is a `web server`
2. What `software` do I need to build a website?
3. How do you `upload files` to a `web server`?

With that basic understanding you'll be ready to work your way through the modules in this section.
